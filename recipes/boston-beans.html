    <h1><p>Description</p></h1>
    <p>Baked beans are the perfect addition to any outdoor cookout or barbecue. These baked beans are slow-cooked in the oven with bacon, onions, and a sweet, syrupy sauce, resulting in an old-fashioned taste that everyone will enjoy. This easy recipe has been served by my family for over 29 years and originally came from my mother-in-law. It tastes great served with fresh cornbread or biscuits and honey.</p>
    <p>ingredients</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups dry navy beans, soaked overnight</li>
        <li>½ pound uncooked bacon strips</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
        <li>½ cup ketchup</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons molasses</li>
    </ul>

    <h1><p>Steps</p></h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Transfer soaked navy beans and soaking water to a saucepan</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until tender, approximately 1 to 2 hours. Drain and reserve the cooking liquid.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).

        </li>
        <li>Combine ketchup, molasses, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, and dry mustard in a large saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Pour sauce over the beans. Pour in just enough reserved cooking liquid to cover the beans. Cover the casserole dish with a lid or aluminum foil.</li>
    </ol>
